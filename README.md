# Robotics@Apex 2024, T2-T3 Passion Project README

## Premise

The popularity of maps and fields in robotics competitions which lack clear and simple lines to follow is on the rise. This is showcased by the difference in the playfield from FLL 2021-2022, Cargo Connect, and FLL 2023-2024, Masterpiece, as well as the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) 2023 to 2024 RoboSports category.

Obviously, for Vex skills, there is always a lack of line following.

As such, in light of these, this project aims to provide for a method of movement on the playfield that is both accurate and precise, and can be used without any lines at all. This method is a mix of odometry, absolute positioning, and movement.
